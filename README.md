# Stock-price-prediction-using-ML-Algorith---Linear-regression

As a data scientist, predicitng the stock price of a necessary share gives lot more benefit to the share holders because, in Share market everyone is keen to make profit through their money and they are always curious about the current as well as Future Stock price.
Hence, I have developed a code that can predict a stock price of a required share based on it's historical data.
