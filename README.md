# Stock-price-prediction-using-ML-Algorith---Linear-regression

As a data scientist, predicitng the stock price of a necessary share gives lot more benefit to the share holders because, in Share market everyone is keen to make profit through their money and they are always curious about the current as well as Future Stock price.
Hence, I have developed a code that can predict a stock price of a required share based on it's historical data.

Python Jupyter notebook -: Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb
CSV file -: Stock_Prices.csv


# If you dont have Application that opens .ipynb (IPython NoteBook) file, you can follow below steps.
1) Go to -> https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
2) Download Anaconda Installer as per your system requirements. If your system is Mac, there is separate version is available. If your system is Windows, you will have different versions over there.
3) Proceed ahead with Anaconda setup.
4) After Installing Anaconda, we can see multiple frameworks such as Jupyter Notebook, Powershell, Visual Studio code etc. you have to choose Jupyter notebook framework.
5) After going into Jupyter Notebook framework, give hard path of .ipynb files in you system to open.
6) In this way you can access .ipynb files with the help of Jupyter notebook Framework and Anaconda Application.
